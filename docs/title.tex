    This paper intruduces the Daily Dashboard, a web application that aims to simplify the management of daily tasks.
    By providing a centralised platform for managing daily tasks, the Daily Dashboard helps users to stay organised throughout the day, while reducing time and complexity.
    This implementation uses a locally deployed database server, a public accessible frontend and user authentication . The paper concludes with other deployment options and functional enhancements.
