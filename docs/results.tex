The Website is accessible from every device with a browser, however it is not made responsive, i.e. the ideal display size is tablet or desktop.
The Weather is displayed correctly, with correct data, but the location can differ from device types.
During testing, on a desktop the location was always correct, but on a mobile device the location often switched to the nearest big city for example Zurich instead of Chur.
