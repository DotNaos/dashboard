Staying organised throughout the day can be a hassle, especially when time is sparse.
There are already many solutions and tools available to help with this, but they are often scattered across different platforms and devices. This can make it difficult to keep track of everything and can lead to important tasks being forgotten or overlooked.
But the biggest drawback is the inconvenience of investing these minutes in the first place.
The Daily Dashboard should solve this problem by being one of the first things you see in the morning and the last thing you see before going to bed.
Serving as the only piece of information you need, before taking on the day and customisable to your needs.
